Remora:
- keep track of route distance as well as time? (i guess we could extrapolate this on the remora side)
- multiple routes display?
- display of all ArbiterInformation info

Errors:
- Uturn barf when stuck outside bounds by tiny bit
- Uturn barf when boundaries too large and can't find min radius circle that matches end tangent. loops around
- Navigation oscillation when in same lane as goal

Other:
- use lane width for uturns if available
- use stopwatch to find bad kludges, ok for now

Notes:
Shop - 1775 hanshaw rd.

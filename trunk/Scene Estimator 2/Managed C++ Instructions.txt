For proper handling of managed / unmanaged C++ interfacing:

For H Files-

Put this chunk at the TOP of the file, but AFTER all your include statements
#ifdef __cplusplus_cli
#pragma managed(push,off)
#endif

Put this chunk at the BOTTOM of the file, but before the last #endif
that you have in there to prevent multiple inclusions.
#ifdef __cplusplus_cli
#pragma managed(pop)
#endif



For CPP Files

Just put this at the top after any #includes you have.
#ifdef __cplusplus_cli
#pragma unmanaged
#endif
